# Fuzzy reasoning mechanism for REBA
The 15 sets of membership degrees, corresponding to the 15 considered submodules generated by scoring models, are ultimately obtained through fuzzy reasoning mechanism, which includes if-then rules, fuzzy operators, and defuzzification methods, to derive the ergonomic risk score.

Within these uploaded files, there are a total of 144 if-then rules distributed across the assessment modules, Table A, Table B, and Table C of REBA. Additionally, the fuzzy operators employed consist of the product t-norm operator and the Einstein Sum s-norm operator. In the process of defuzzification, the Center of Area (CoA) method has been chosen for implementation.

Furthermore, we also provide the process of generating membership degrees for the five body segments. This process facilities the transformation of membership degrees from the joint level to the body-segment level.
